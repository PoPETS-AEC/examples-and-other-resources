# Which license should I choose for my artifact?

- For a clear, easy to follow guide see: https://choosealicense.com/
- For more in-depth detail on open source and copy-left licenses, see
  https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html and
  https://opensource.org/licenses.
- Before you begin extending other authors' libraries, check that doing so would
  comply with the terms of the license.
- Some restrictive licenses also exist for authors concerned about IP
  protections and commercialization prospects.
