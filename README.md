# examples-and-other-resources

Examples and other resources provided to PETS authors for software artifact
packaging.

This repository is itself a demonstration of how to use [git
submodules](resources/git-submodules.md).

Our resources are nowhere near complete and are only here to facilitate and
demonstrate some ways (others exist!) to package artifacts for authors of
accepted PETS papers. We welcome suggestions in the form of issues or pull
requests.

## License Notes

- These examples are released into the public domain (see [The Unlicense](LICENSE))
- This is to facilitate things, so that authors do not need to give us
  attribution if they re-use our examples.
- Authors who fork one of our examples as a starter repository, will likely want
  to pick another license for their artifact.
